            God can take something so devastating as cancer and depression, and
            turn it around for good. God gave Wendy the the gift of humour to
            get through her various battles, and I heard just what I needed to
            get through mine.&rdquo;

            hearts of our guests that night. The next morning, she spoke and
            sang to an audience in a camp setting made up mostly of youth.
            Parents and leaders remarked at how everyone was engaged by her

            Most meaningful and poignant were her life stories - conversations

            as they related to someone we knew. As she shared her testimony, our

            spokesperson for God. We hope and pray that your message of hope
            will be heard by many people in Canada as well as other countries.

            &ldquo;I have had the opportunity to see Wendy perform in various
            venues and activities. She has a very smart, witty and clean humour
            to her act and performs it seamlessly with her singing and guitar
            playing. She has performed at various church activities and has
            always been able to &ldquo;read the crowd&rdquo; and connect at
            will. She is a good listener and wants to ensure all she does will
            meet the expectations of those for whom she is performing. I
            overwhelmingly endorse her for and public performance involving
            comedy, music and a personal story that is sure to be

            &ldquo;Wendy brought a sense of authenticity and outrageous humour
            to our Sunday evening service and allowed the people to laugh - at
            themselves as well as the very difficult situations they find
            themselves in. Keeping it real and delivering the message of
            God&rsquo;s love and grace is Wendy&rsquo;s strength. We enjoyed her

            &ldquo;We were richly blessed to have Wendy spend a few days with us
            at South Range Christian Church. Her humour left us in stitches and
            her music lifted our hearts. Wendy was transparent about her
            journey, specifically as one who has faced the personal battles and
            the social stigma that come with clinical depression. She reminded
            us that we have a God who is bigger than life&rsquo;s struggles, Who
            can be trusted to carry us through whatever comes, and that laughter
            can be wonderful medicine for an unwanted diagnosis.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Perhaps what excited me most about Wendy&rsquo;s message was not
            only that she encouraged those who attended, but that their
            participation has spawned dialogue on what we can do locally to
            minister to those we know of who struggle with mental illness. To
            listen to our people discussing the possibilities of how we might
            reach out with the love of Christ to hurting souls in our community
            confirmed for me that this was a God-timed event. If you have the
            chance to have Wendy come and share her story with your congregation
            or organization, grab it! You will be blessed.&rdquo;

            loves Jesus Christ and this is abundantly clear in her testimony. He
            has done great things in her life. She is honest and not afraid to
            challenge us to step out of our comfort zones. Wendy came to
            Fellowship Baptist Church Kanata in December 2010, just after our
            church had lost several of our cherished and loved members to
            cancer. We had experienced several deaths in the past two years.
            Wendy is herself a cancer survivor; and she shares the pain and more
            importantly, the joy of her cancer journey. Imagine how her message
            impacted our women! How can one experience joy while struggling with
            chemo, radiation, surgeries, ongoing doctor&rsquo;s appointments and
            the secondary illnesses that result from all of those interventions?
            As I said, Wendy has a powerful and uplifting message for those who
            will share their time with her. If you are looking for a way to

            positive outlook and the joy she has found in Christ.&nbsp; Her

            &ldquo;What a FANTASTIC night with Wendy Farha! When the women were
            not roaring with laughter, they were crying with tears of laughter.
            Wendy is a gifted comedian! Our guests were moved by the
            authenticity of her life story. We had many non- Christians attend
            this event and the message of the gospel was presented in a gentle
            and loving way. Wendy spent considerable time with many women
            afterwards which was so appreciated. This is a fantastic ministry

            &quot;Some time ago, we invited Wendy Farha to minister at our
            &lsquo;60&#39;s Plus&#39; Seniors group of about 150 people at
            Central Community Church.&nbsp; I am the Director of this group.
            Wendy is a very gifted lady whose ministry is a delightful mixture
            of God&#39;s Word (presented in an edifying and easy to understand
            manner), excellent and enjoyable musical talent (she writes and
            plays all of her own songs), and comedy (she is absolutely
            hilarious!) Wendy has passed through difficult times in her life,
            including cancer, and has chosen to use these experiences to bring
            hope, understanding, strength, healing and laughter to others in
            their journeys through life. After experiencing Wendy&#39;s
            ministry, you will understand the meaning of the verse, &quot;a
            merry heart does good like medicine.&quot; Our time together with
            Wendy ended with her giving a brief and very clear presentation of
            the gospel message. People left our seniors meeting that day feeling
            happy, lighthearted, refreshed and inspired, and with a clear
            understanding of what it means to be a child of our Heavenly Father.
            We look forward to her ministry again in the future.&quot;

            which was disarmingly hilarious! &ndash; to the hilarious songs, to
            sharing some deep struggles and challenges you have gone through in
            your life, the participants came away with a clear understanding
            that joy isn&rsquo;t dependent on everything being great! Your
            personal journey helped &ldquo;humanize&rdquo; the Christian journey
            &ndash; which we sometimes over-emphasis as being
            &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; &ndash; something non-Christians have a hard
            time swallowing (or desiring). Thank you for helping us and our
            guests see the way Christ gives us hope through our ups and our
            downs! Another thing that impressed me was that you took time before
            and during the meal to walk around the room and converse with the
            people at their tables. Several people mentioned they had very much
            enjoyed you being that up close and personal.

            seniors group who had just found out in previous weeks that the
            husband has two cancerous growths on his kidneys. They had decided
            not to come because they were not in the mood for comedy, but ended
            up feeling prompted to come anyway. They spoke with me later to say
            that the evening had been exactly what they needed &ndash; both
            because they needed to laugh but also to see that joy can still be
            experienced within their difficult health journey.

            say how much their friends had enjoyed the evening and how your
            testimony, in particular, caused them to have to consider the
            strength that faith in God brings to people. There have been several
            follow up conversations as a result. God used you to open doorways
            to believers and unbelievers through humour and honesty about the

            number of people came, an indication of how many people struggle
            with this problem. Wendy is not a trained psychologist, but shared
            insights that were extremely helpful and insightful. Those in the
            group were able to identify with her and found hope in what she
            shared. I was particularly impressed with how she spent a

            when you have Jesus in your life, you shouldn&rsquo;t be depressed
            &hellip; should you? This really just made my depression worse
            because not only was I depressed, I felt like I was a failure as a
            Christian. Years later I found out about Prozac. Life returned to
            normal, which was great, not only for me but also for my family, who
            had also been through a terrible time because of my depression. Your
            presentation was excellent because it was so down to earth and
            honest, which put people at ease right away. Your humour was great,

            her_ Depression Awareness Seminar_. Even though the topic of
            depression can be somewhat challenging to present, Wendy did an
            amazing job using humour, music, grace and candor. She was able to
            help us understand and bring the struggle with depression to each of
            us by sharing her own very personal life story. She helped people in
            the congregation identify their mental health concerns and reach out
            for assistance. The overwhelming theme that shone through her
            presentation with clarity and hope is that depression is very real
            and there is help available. She is an engaging speaker and we were
            blessed to have her!&rdquo;

            &ldquo;Wendy was our guest speaker for our Celebrate Recovery
            &ldquo;Testimony Night&rdquo;. There was a powerful move of God as
            she incorporated her Holy Spirit-led humor and music in between the
            testimonies of changed lives. She also gave her amazing testimony.
            We all experienced a &ldquo;roller coaster&rdquo; of emotions as she
            brought us through pain, healing, deliverance, laughter and praise.
            It was a mighty ushering in of the Presence of God. I recommend
            Wendy for any event as she is very sensitive to the Spirit and has
            so much material - songs, humor and life experience - that she can
            apply to any situation.&rdquo;

            morning worship with her testimony and music, she had the crowd
            laughing with her comedy at our outreach event on Sunday night, and
            was the guest testimony for our Celebrate Recovery group on Monday
            night. What more could we ask of her? She exceeded our expectations
            in every area at three different events. She was great and we want
            to have her back again!&rdquo;

            honest stories of the struggles God has seen her through, her
            battles with depression and ill health. Many people were blessed and
            encouraged after listening to Wendy&rsquo;s uplifting stories. We

            and we look forward to following her ministry as God uses her in the

            that there is hope. She made us all laugh and have fun, and shared
            her story of how Christ has helped her through cancer and
            depression.

            is a prime example of just what Christ can do for us if we are

            &ldquo;Last Saturday night at Stephen&rsquo;s Anglican Church, we
            were entertained by the music and humour of Wendy Farha. Wendy had
            us laughing one minute as she told us her &lsquo;pantyhose
            story&rsquo;, running for the bus with her guitar in one hand and
            stuff in the other while her pantyhose made their way to her knees,
            and then had us singing along or pondering the words to a song she
            had written about relationships or the names of Jesus. Wendy is a
            gifted singer and songwriter and we were all blessed by her talents
            and delightful personality. I feel that she was one of God&rsquo;s
            best kept secrets until meeting her Saturday. Thank God the
            secret&rsquo;s out and I hope to hear of her performing more and
            more. God&rsquo;s richest blessings, Wendy, as you continue to
            venture out in His Mighty Name and purpose for your
            life.&ldquo;&nbsp; <em>~ Melody S</em>.

            connect in small or medium sized venues and can teach and/or
            entertain through riveting storytelling, audience participation and
            just incredible original humor. Check out her website and blog for
            an amazing tour through her life and prepare to be both challenged

            &ldquo;It was a wonderful evening. Her solo concert came off more
            like Wendy Farha hosting an intimate gathering of friends, though
            most of us had never met. There were great laughs and songs, but
            also, Wendy makes us feel good inside. When I think of Wendy, I
            think of the term &ldquo;live wire!&rdquo; Her exuberance is catchy;
            she is a born entertainer! However, when I think of the strength of
            humanity and exponents thereof, I reflect on Wendy&rsquo;s sharing
            of her experience, strength and hope - and the challenges she
            personally has overcome. Wendy, we salute you!&ldquo;&nbsp; ~

            both great and small, Wendy has an ability to make anyone feel
            better about themselves and see the beauty of life and that we all
            have purpose and meaning in every situation, communicating her life
            story in various forms to bring encouragement to those who come in
            contact with her. Wendy is just one of those people that always
            leaves a positive footprint in the lives of those she

            funny and she&rsquo;s got a great voice! When a single performer is
